 ## 📖 Overview

The **Online Bookstore Management System** is a console-based application developed using pure **Core Java** concepts such as **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Collections**, and **File Handling**. It simulates an online platform where users can **browse, purchase, and manage books** without relying on any external frameworks or databases.

The system provides an automated solution to efficiently manage **book inventory**, **user registration**, and **sales records**. It serves as a **mini e-commerce system** built entirely in Java, demonstrating how fundamental programming principles can be applied to design a complete management system.

The application offers two main interfaces:

- **Administrator Interface:** Allows the admin to add, update, delete, and view available books in the store.  
- **Customer Interface:** Enables users to register, log in, view available books, add them to a cart, and place orders.
