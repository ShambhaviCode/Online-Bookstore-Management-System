Overview

The Online Bookstore Management System is a console-based application developed using pure Core 
Java concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Collections, and File Handling. The system 
aims to simulate an online platform where users can browse, purchase, and manage books without 
relying on any external frameworks or databases. Provides an automated solution to handle book 
inventory, user registration, and sales records efficiently. It serves as a mini e-commerce system built 
entirely in Java, demonstrating how fundamental programming principles can be used to design a 
complete management system. 

The system provides two main interfaces: 
• Administrator Interface: Allows the admin to add, update, delete, and view available books in 
the store. 
• Customer Interface: Enables users to register, log in, view available books, add them to a cart, 
and place orders.

Objectives: 
✓ To automate the process of book selling and inventory management. 
✓ To demonstrate the use of Core Java features in developing a functional console-based 
application. 
✓ To ensure data persistence using file handling techniques. 
✓ To design a simple and user-friendly interface for both administrators and customers. 

Problem Statement: 
In traditional bookstores, managing book inventory, tracking sales, and handling customer records 
manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors. As the number of books and customers 
increases, maintaining accurate records becomes increasingly difficult. The Online Bookstore 
Management System aims to overcome these challenges by providing a computerized solution that 
automates book management, sales tracking, and customer operations. This system ensures faster 
processing, improved accuracy, and easier access to information all within a simple console-based 
Java application.

Intended Beneficiaries of the Project: 
The Online Bookstore Management System is designed to benefit the following users: 
▪ Administrators: To easily manage book inventory, update stock, and track sales without manual 
effort. 
▪ Customers: To browse, search, and purchase books conveniently through a simple console 
interface. 
▪ Bookstore Owners: To maintain accurate records of books and transactions, improving efficiency 
and reducing errors.

Step-by-Step Implementation of Online Bookstore Management System: 
Step 1: Create the Project 
➢ Open your preferred Java IDE such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, or even use a simple text 
editor like Notepad. 
➢ Create a new Java Project named “OnlineBookstore”. 
➢ Inside the project, create a package named com.bookstore (optional if not using an IDE). 
➢ Add a new Java class file named OnlineBookstore.java. 
➢ Set up the main method to serve as the entry point of the program.

// File: OnlineBookstore.java 
// Package declaration (optional, but recommended if using an IDE) 
package com.bookstore; 
public class OnlineBookstore { 
public static void main(String[] args) { 
System.out.println("Welcome to the Online Bookstore!"); 
// Entry point of the application 
// Future steps will add more functionality here 
} 
}
